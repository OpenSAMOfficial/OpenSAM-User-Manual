The \textbf{\textsf{OpenSAM}} by OHM is developed for filmmaking amateurs and professionals. The technology used allows a broad spectrum of cameras of varying sizes and weights to be stabilized. The unique use of 3D printing technology for the custom parts allows easy reproduction and any design changes can easily be implemented. The 3D prints are also lightweight and allow for a convenient use. No specialized 3D printers are needed. All parts were printed using Ultimaker Original 3D Printers or Bq Witbox 3D Printers and their files have been made available under an open source license.\par
The brushless gimbal stabilization system works on three brushless motors moving on the axes. One 8-bit brushless gimbal controller (BGC), an expansion card and an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) is all the electronics needed for assembly.
