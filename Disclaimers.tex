\section{Using Lithium Polymer (LiPo) Batteries}

Using the \textbf{\textsf{OpenSAM}} requires the use of an external LiPo battery, which can be extremely hazardous if handled incorrectly. General care should be followed when using LiPo batteries:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Always use the correct charger when charging the battery.
\item Batteries are normally designed to stop charging when full, however it is good practice to
monitor their charging progress and disconnect them from the charger once they are fully
charged.
\item Do not charge the battery near flammable materials or on flammable surfaces such as carpet
or wood.
\item Never use or charge a swollen, leaking or otherwise damaged battery.
\item Keep both the battery and the charger dry at all times.
\item Do not expose the battery to extreme temperatures.
\item Keep batteries away from strong electrostatic or electromagnetic interferences.
\item Do not place the battery in a microwave oven.
\end{enumerate}
