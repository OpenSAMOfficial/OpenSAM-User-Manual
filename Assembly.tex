\item \hfill \\
Part [15] is mounted underneath part [7] using two 4,5mm bolts and nuts.
\item \hfill \\
A motor (part [1]) is attached on the back of part [7] using four 3mm bolts. Choose the holes on part [7] so that when a camera is mounted in one of the two bottom holes, the camera’s center of mass will align with the motor’s rotational axis.
\item \hfill \\
Mount part [8] on the motor (part [1]) using three 2,5mm bolts.
\item The basecamp-mainboard-case is placed at position [14] at the back of part [8] using a
reattachable fastener of your choice.
\item \hfill \\
The basecamp-mainboard is put into the case
\item \hfill \\
Put a new motor on part [8] using four 3mm bolts.
\item \hfill \\
Part [9] is put through part [2] and attached to part [8] using a 4,5mm screw in one side, and
three 2,5mm bolts on the motor (part [1])
\item \hfill \\
Put part [4] and part [5] together using 3mm bolts and nuts, to assemble the handlebar.
\item \hfill \\
Mount the last motor (part [1]) on the handlebar using three 2,5mm bolts. If the one-
handed grip (part [10]) is used, it needs to be mounted in between the handlebar and the
new motor.
\item \hfill \\
Put the handlebar through part [2] and mounted to the upper motor using four 3mm bolts.
\item \hfill \\
Use two 4mm bolts and nuts to fasten and position the camera’s center of mass so it aligns
with the motor’s rotational axis.
\item \hfill \\
Mount both parts [6] to the handlebar using two long (approx. 80mm length) woodscrews.
\item \hfill \\
Put the joystick into part [3] and mount it to the right part [6] using a tie-wrap.
\item \hfill \\
If part [10] is mounted, attach part [11] using proper sized woodscrews.
\item \hfill \\
The basecamp-yawboard-case is placed at position [13] at the back of part [8] using a
reattachable fastener of your choice.
\item \hfill \\
The basecamp- yawboard is put into the case
